  "about": "Hello! My name is Brittany and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS! :::Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at an advertising agency,a start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients.",
